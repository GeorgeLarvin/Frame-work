# Frame-work
this is the start of me, creating my own framework
this framework will be called GreetR.
it will be a simple framework that greets people in differnt languages when they log in.

# what will it support 
it will support both english and spanish to start with
and will include both formal and informal greetings
and it will also be jQuery compatible.
it will be reusable code and will not clash with any other frameworks you are using
and it will use a "Easy to type" method such as G$()

#update 1

# update 2 in the lastest GreetR update

#update 3 jQuery support added 
Jquery support added and working!

#All done 
all featres working fine and all code commented incase I come back and add more features.
