# Frame-work
this is the start of me, creating my own framework
this framework will be called GreetR.
it will be a simple framework that greets people in differnt languages when they log in.

# what will it support 
it will support both english and spanish to start with
and will include both formal and informal greetings
and it will also be jQuery compatible.
it will be reusable code and will not clash with any other frameworks you are using
and it will use a "Easy to type" method such as G$()

#in the lastest GreetR update
its not working propely you have to use setLang to get the no formal greet to work 
not sure why
